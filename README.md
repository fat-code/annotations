# Igni Annotations

## Introduction
Igni annotations is an attempt to provide meta data programing for php by extending docblock comments.
Syntax is compatible with latest [annotations rfc](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/annotations_v2), with couple exceptions:
- There is no `@Compiled`(there is no compiling), `@SupressWarning`, `@Inherited` nor `@Repeatable` (all annotations are repeatable) annotations
-
